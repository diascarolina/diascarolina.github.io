Hello and welcome! 👋

I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Federal University of Ceará. At the end of my degree, I gravitated towards the tech side of things, learning about Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, as well as Software Engineering and Computer Science. In it I could see an area that is so much more than just "coding" and that is what I've been looking for since forever. This allowed me to mix many areas of interest and to become an interdisciplinary professional. 📝

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Creditas, learning constantly how to deploy and maintain models in production to try to answer the old question of "how to put machine learning to use in the real world?". Previously I've leaned on some computer science, working for three years in undergraduate research at the ParGO Research Group (Parallel Computing, Graph Theory and Optimization) in the area of Graph Theory, focused on graph convexity and algorithmic complexity, gaining knowledge in the more theoretic side of CS. 👩‍💻

As for the technical details, I believe in not being attached to one particular tool, and instead to focus on solving problems, a skill I acquired from my math degree. My main working language is focused but not limited to Python. Other tools I use are SQL, Git, Docker and cloud services such as AWS and GCP. I'm also interested in the data analysis side of things and in making beautiful data visualizations. 📊

In my spare time I like to share what I'm (always) learning and write about tech and math at [Medium](https://carodias.medium.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
